# Next.js 15 App Router: Server Component Dynamic Route Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered in Next.js 15's App Router when using server components with dynamic routes.  The server component fails to properly render when accessing dynamic route parameters.

## Bug Description

When a server component attempts to access a dynamic route parameter (e.g., `params.id`), the component fails to render correctly, potentially resulting in an error or unexpected output. This behavior seems inconsistent with expectations.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Navigate to a dynamic route (e.g., `/blog/1`).
5. Observe the unexpected rendering behavior or error.

## Expected Behavior

The server component should correctly access and render data based on the dynamic route parameters.

## Actual Behavior

The server component either fails to render, produces an error, or renders incorrectly, displaying unexpected data or behavior.

## Solution

See `bugSolution.js` for a potential workaround or fix (if one is available).
